# Class Portal, Milestone 1 Process

For this project, I was tasked to design and code a website that will act as a class portal for Front End Web Development and link to all of the work I create in this class. My design is inspired by a wireframe I create for a hand coded portfolio that I never got around to making. I really loved the design I came up with but didnâ€™t have enough time to hand code this portfolio in time for applying to internships. However, when I came across it when starting this project, I was super excited and inspired that I would get to use this long-lost idea in a smaller project.

My class portal will use color blocking for its organization. As a designer, I think color blocking is a great option for organization because it can look professional but is also fun and showcases color. Additionally, this organization adapts well between mobile and web applications because the blocks can just be sized up or down depending on the device. 

The colors I picked are cheery yet slightly muted, making them subtle and not too overbearing in my design. These colors create an interesting combination that is not seen too often but really represents me and my personality. Color is something that really inspired me when I design, and therefore I wanted to make it the focal point of my class portal. With using these bright colors, I will be careful not to take away from the actual projects I am uploading to my class portal. My plan is to make the headings of each page colorful, but the text and other elements will remain neutral.

The designs shown below are wireframes I created on Figma to showcase the home page of my class portal in both a web application and mobile application. In the web application, there is my logo as well as a nav bar for moving between the different pages I plan on creating. There is a pink heading which showcases the name of this class for users to reference for context. Below that are large buttons that will link to the different pages. Finally, there is a footer with links to my portfolio, email and GitHub.

For the mobile application home page, it is similar to the web application, but I took out the nav bar. Starting at the top, we have my logo, the class title, and then the buttons for the different pages, which are laid out vertically. The same footer is at the bottom.

The architecture of my site is pretty simple. The home page will link to the other 4 pages: labs, projects, process, and code. On the web application users can navigate via the nav bar and can get back to the home page by clicking my logo. For the mobile application, since I removed the nav bar for aesthetic reasons, I am going to see if a back button system will work here. The user will click on a page and exit it through a back button that will bring them to the home page. From there they can click to a different page. If this plan is clunky in practice, I will supplement a nav bar with a hamburger menu in the top right corner for navigation purposes. 

In order to make the mobile application wireframe, I created a frame that is the size of a phone screen, and then copied everything over from the web application, sizing it down as needed. In full transparency, I have never designed the front end of a website to be responsive based on-screen size, so I am slightly nervous to see if my plan (adjusting the size of all the different elements) will work. However, I am more than willing to adapt my design as necessary in order to make sure it works on all screen sizes. That being said, I am excited to continue learning in the second phase of this project and class!
